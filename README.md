# Ultra-Marathon Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes ultra-marathon data from a dataset spanning 2010 to 2022. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy, the notebook provides insights into trends and patterns in ultra-marathon events, focusing on aspects like gender distribution, race distances, and athlete performance.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

## Initial exploration of the dataset using methods like .head(), .shape, and .describe() to understand its structure and key statistics.
Visualizations:

Distribution of race distances (50mi and 50km) using histograms.
Gender breakdown of athletes presented through a pie chart.
Speed analysis for different race categories using KDE plots.
Statistical Analysis:

## Investigations into average speeds and other performance metrics for athletes.
Visualizations
Some visualizations generated in this project include:

Gender Distribution:
A pie chart visualizing male and female athlete proportions.
Race Distance Distribution:
Histograms showing the frequency of races for 50mi and 50km.
Athlete Speed Comparison:
KDE plots comparing speeds across different race categories
